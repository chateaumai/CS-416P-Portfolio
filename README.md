## Overview
[Notebook](notebook.md)

This repo will contain the assignments for this class, as well as my notebook that keeps track of my work.

The files are located under the `code` folder.

In `sound-files` are the outputs from my code.

clipped.wav is from clipped-hw1.py

RAW_my_amazing_loop.wav, compressed.wav, and equalized_audio.wav are all for fft.py
RAW_my_amazing_loop.wav is the original file, so that you can hear the differences in compressed and equalized_audio.

and the last file popgen_third_harmonic_no_click.wav is from popgen
